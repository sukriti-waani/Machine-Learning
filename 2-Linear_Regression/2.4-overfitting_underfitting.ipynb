    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, data is divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training Dataset  \n",
    "2. Validation Dataset  \n",
    "3. Test Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Split\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training data → 70%\n",
    "- Test data → 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "## 5️⃣ Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when:\n",
