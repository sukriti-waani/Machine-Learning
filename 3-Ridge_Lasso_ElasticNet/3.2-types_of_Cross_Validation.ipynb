    "# 📘 Types of Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ What is Cross Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Validation is a technique used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train the model  \n",
    "2. Tune hyperparameters  \n",
    "3. Check model performance on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps in avoiding **overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Dataset Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Dataset → 1000 records\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Data → 70% (700)\n",
    "- Testing Data → 30% (300)\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data is again split into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train\n",
    "- Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This internal split is called **Cross Validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "In LOOCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If total samples = n  \n",
    "- Training samples = n − 1  \n",
    "- Validation samples = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated **n times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If n = 500 → 500 experiments are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of LOOCV\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses almost all data for training\n",
    "- Very accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of LOOCV\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very high computation cost\n",
    "- Very slow for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is divided into **k equal parts (folds)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "n = 500, k = 5  \n",
    "Each fold size = 500 / 5 = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working of K-Fold CV\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use 4 folds for training  \n",
    "2. Use 1 fold for validation  \n",
    "3. Repeat for all folds  \n",
    "4. Take **average accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Used mainly in **Classification** problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It keeps the **same class proportion** in all folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If dataset has:\n",
    "- 60% class A\n",
    "- 40% class B\n",
    "\n",
    "Each fold will also have:\n",
    "- 60% class A\n",
    "- 40% class B\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Time Series Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when data depends on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Product reviews by month\n",
    "- Stock price prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series CV Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Past data is used to predict **future data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training:\n",
    "Day 1 → Day 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation:\n",
    "Day 5 → Day N\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Overfitting Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- High Training Accuracy  \n",
    "- Low Validation Accuracy  \n",
    "\n",
    "This means the model is **Overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Comparison Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV:\n",
    "- High accuracy\n",
    "- Very slow\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold:\n",
    "- Balanced approach\n",
    "- Most commonly used\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified K-Fold:\n",
    "- Best for imbalanced classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series CV:\n",
    "- Used when order of data matters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross Validation improves model reliability\n",
    "- LOOCV → n experiments\n",
    "- K-Fold → average of k accuracies\n",
    "- Stratified CV keeps class ratio\n",
    "- Time Series CV respects time order\n"
