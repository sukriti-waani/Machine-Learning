    "\n",
    "## 1. Learning in Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine Learning learns patterns from data to perform tasks such as:\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "- Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning can be broadly divided into:\n",
    "- Instance Based Learning\n",
    "- Model Based Learning\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Instance Based Learning\n",
    "Instance Based Learning is a learning technique where the model **memorizes the training data** and makes predictions by **comparing new data with stored instances**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no explicit model creation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working of Instance Based Learning\n",
    "1. Store all training data\n",
    "2. When a new input comes:\n",
    "   - Compare it with stored data\n",
    "   - Find the most similar instances\n",
    "3. Predict output based on similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "This learning happens **at query time**, not during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Memorizes training data\n",
    "- No generalization during training\n",
    "- Prediction is delayed until query is received\n",
    "- Requires full dataset to be stored\n",
    "- Needs domain expertise for distance measures\n",
