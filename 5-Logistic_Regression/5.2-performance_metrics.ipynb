    "\n",
    "1. Confusion Matrix  \n",

    "## 2️⃣ Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A Confusion Matrix shows the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "|               | Actual = 1 | Actual = 0 |\n",
    "|---------------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| Predicted = 1 | TP         | FP         |\n",
    "| Predicted = 0 | FN         | TN         |\n",

    "TP → True Positive  \n",
    "FP → False Positive  \n",
    "FN → False Negative  \n",
    "TN → True Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy tells how many predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Problem with Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "If dataset is imbalanced, accuracy becomes misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Total records = 1000  \n",
    "- 900 → Class 1  \n",
    "- 100 → Class 0  \n",
    "\n",
    "If model predicts all as Class 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy = 900 / 1000 = 90% ❌  \n",
    "But model is actually useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of all **predicted positives**, how many are actually correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of all **actual positives**, how many did we correctly predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",

    "- Precision → How many emails predicted as spam are actually spam  \n",
    "- Recall → How many real spam emails were detected\n",

    "## 8️⃣ Precision & Recall Example – Disease Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth → Person has disease  \n",
    "Model → Predicts no disease  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **False Negative (FN)** – very dangerous mistake.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ F-Beta Score\n",
    "\n",
    "F-Beta Score combines Precision and Recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fβ Score = (1 + β²) × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",

    "## 🔟 F-1 Score (β = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "When both Precision and Recall are equally important:\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",

    "## 1️⃣1️⃣ F-0.5 Score (FP is more important than FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "β = 0.5  \n",
    "Used when False Positives are more costly.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Accuracy is not reliable for imbalanced datasets  \n",
    "- Precision focuses on **quality of positive predictions**  \n",
