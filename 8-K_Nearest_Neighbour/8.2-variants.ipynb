    "## 🔹 Why Variants of KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal KNN, we calculate distance from the test point to **every training point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **Time Complexity = O(n)**  \n",
    "For large datasets (millions of points), this becomes very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize this, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KD Tree**  \n",
    "2. **Ball Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ KD Tree (K-Dimensional Tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "KD Tree is a **binary tree** that divides data based on feature dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Construction of KD Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose one feature (f₁ or f₂).\n",
    "2. Find the **median value** of that feature.\n",
    "3. Split the data into left and right parts.\n",
    "4. Repeat the process alternately for each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example shown in diagram:\n",

    "| 2 | 3 |\n",
    "| 4 | 7 |\n",
    "| 8 | 1 |\n",

    "- Traverse tree like **binary search**.\n",
    "- Use **backtracking** when required.\n",

    "Ball Tree groups data points into **balls (clusters)**.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **center point**\n",
    "- A **radius** covering nearby points\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Construction of Ball Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide dataset into groups.\n",
    "2. Each group is enclosed inside a **ball (circle)**.\n",
    "3. Balls are recursively split into smaller balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Searching in Ball Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance is calculated between **test point and ball center**.\n",
