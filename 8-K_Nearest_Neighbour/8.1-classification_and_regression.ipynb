    "1. **Classification**\n",
    "2. **Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "It works on the principle of **similarity** –  \n",

    "- KNN is a **lazy learning algorithm** (no training phase).  \n",
    "- It is used for **Classification and Regression**.  \n",
    "- Works by finding **K nearest neighbours** using distance metrics.  \n",
    "- Uses **majority voting** for classification and **average** for regression.  \n",
    "- Time complexity is **O(n)** but can be optimized using **KD-Tree / Ball Tree**.\n"
